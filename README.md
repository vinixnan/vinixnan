# Hey 👋, This is Vinicius de Carvalho

My engineering career started as a Web Developer, where I made my first experiences with web services and systems using PHP and Java EE. Even though I liked the work I became very interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence 👨🏻‍💻 and its applications so that I decided to take up full-time studies 💡 as a Phd candidate 🎓 at the University of Sao Paulo 🏛 in the areas of Evolutionary Computing for multi-objective optimization and auto-selection for Machine Learning algorithms. There I work on problems such as Class integration Test Order, Travel Salesman Problem, and Vehicle Crashworthiness optimization. Recently, I have been studying the combination of multi-agent, evolutionary computation, and machine learning techniques in order to produce autonomous algorithms. Apart from my graduate program, I have been studying Deep Leaning and other machine learning techniques such as clustering and regression.
