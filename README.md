# Hey 👋, This is Vinicius de Carvalho

A doctor in Computer engineering who really enjoys machine learning stuff and everything related to cloud computing. Ten years ago, my career started as a Web Developer, where I had some experience with web services and systems designed using PHP and Java. After working for almost three years in the industry, I became very interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its applications, so I decided to take up full-time studies as a graduate student in the areas of Evolutionary Computing for multi-objective optimization and auto-selection for Machine Learning algorithms. In my research, I dealt with problems from Software engineering, Logistics, Engineering, and mathematical optimization by always applying state-of-art AI algorithms. In terms of programming languages, in my career at the university, I used Java and Python (this last one is especially for data analysis). Three years ago I came back to the industry as a machine learning engineer, where I designed a recommendation system (coded in PHP and Python) and also helped in AWS Cloud improvements (Docker, EC2 autoscaling, and VPC) for an e-commerce website. Finally, I started to work as a back-end engineer/DevOps, where I was able to improve CI/CD, by improving Jenkinsfile and Dockerfiles, and by improving code performance and code test coverage for Python and Java. Apart from that, I keep studying ML and Cloud (especially AWS) as shown by my recent AWS certifications.
